# Volume_Hand_Control
## Computer vision

## Volume hand control project is deep learning project based on 
### - hand tracking
### - getting indexes of thumb and index fingers 
### - calculate distance between them 
### - map the distance to applicable volume
### - set this value to the volume of the device

## How is hand trackingn done in computer vision ?
### For hand tracking there are two models running at the backend  :
#### 1- Palm detection : crop the hand from a complete image
#### 2- Hand landmarks : form 21 landmark on the croped image of the hand

## libraries used :
### opencv
### mediapipe
### pycaw
### numpy
